            				Note: if I have a 3-digit number then each of the digits is raised to the power of three and
            				added to obtain a number. If the number obtained equals the original number then,
            				 we call that armstrong number.
            				Armstrong numbers are     === 153 370 371 407 === for 3 digits


             Task 5: Write a method that return a new string where the first and last chars have been exchanged.
                         frontBack("code") → "eodc"
                         frontBack("a") → "a"
                         frontBack("ab") → "ba"
